It still has far to go and currently remains an imperfect tool. Before marketers pop the champagne and think this is the ticket to slashing budgets and getting copy written faster and cheaper than ever, there are some risks that need to be carefully considered.\\nAll artificial intelligence systems work the same way. They are trained with a sample of data that they categorise using rules. ChatGPT has been trained with a massive set of data and about 175 billion parameters. It differs from other AI models because it also uses human feedback during its training so the risk of harmful, false, and biassed outputs is reduced, although its not completely removed. This makes it more accurate than other AI models  but its not perfect.\\nHere are five reasons why it might be dangerous for your business to rely on ChatGPT as your new copywriter:\\nIt makes mistakes\\nChatGPT may seem all-knowing but its not infallible. The Stack Overflow website, which is used by coders to answer questions about programming, has banned answers from ChatGPT because they are often wrong. The big problem,\\naccording to the site moderators\\n, is that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good. While ChatGPT may be useful for initial research, it is not 100% trustworthy. There have been many examples where ChatGPT invents and cites fabricated research. ChatGPTs facts have to be independently cross referenced to ensure you are not releasing content that is found to be fake, wrong or misleading as this can make your business look incompetent or worse untrustworthy and misleading customers, dropping you into a crisis or resulting in legal issues.\\nThere is no style\\nWe need to be mindful of what ChatGPT cant do. Because its been trained with a specific set of data, the answers it can give are a reflection of that data. So, you could ask ChatGPT to write a sonnet in the style of Shakespeare, but it can not create its own style. If you want your words to sound like they come from your business, are consistent with your brand messaging, tone and identity, youll need to write them yourself.\\nContextual awareness\\nWhen youre writing copy for your website, a blog article or for publication with the media, specific context matters. While ChatGPT has probably read more data than any one person could in a lifetime, it doesnt understand the context of those words, where they have been used or where they may be used in the future. ChatGPTs understanding of context is based on how frequently words occur close to each other rather than real situational awareness. ChatGPT is not cognisant of shifts in social expectations and may offend sections of the community, leading to your business being embroiled in a controversy that impacts your reputation negatively. ChatGPT also doesnt understand your marketing objectives nor has any understanding of your customers and what will resonate and what may antagonise them.\\nJack of all trades\\nThe saying Jack of all trades, master of none applies to ChatGPT. While ChatGPT has an approximate knowledge of many things, it is not a subject matter expert. The people in your business are the experts in specific fields. When writing content to support your business, in alignment with your tone of voice, brand pillars and values, you need to lean into your understanding. This will often go beyond facts. Great writing is a reflection of experience as well as information. ChatGPT can give you facts, with varying degrees of accuracy, but it doesnt have your brand knowledge and experience.\\nSources and a legal unknown\\nChatGPT is based on another AI tool called GPT-3. This was trained with millions of books as well as data from internet databases and other sources. According to its creators, OpenAI, it has learned by reading about 300 billion words. When ChatGPT returns an answer you have no way of knowing what sources it used and, unless you do some follow up, whether its responses are actually original. This could lead to legal issues like those Dall-E, the image processing equivalent of ChatGPT, has faced.\\nChatGPT can be a helpful tool. Like Wikipedia and other online resources, it can be a useful starting point for research or to get ideas. But it cant replace the creativity, awareness and experience that human writers bring and it cannot undertake risk management to ensure your brand thrives free from controversy.","snippet":"All <b><b>artificial intelligence</b></b> systems work the same way.

It\'s the result of the data behind it.\\ngetty\\nCan artificial intelligence make us more creative and innovative? Its a subject of hot debate and discussion. A recent analysisout of the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute suggests that, yes, AI can help us expand our range of innovation.\\nAlong with handling the mundane, AI can also take over more creative tasks by identifying patterns in data that humans would not have found, the studys author, Jan Bieser points out. In this case, AI does not just take over tasks that would be time-consuming; it might provide insights humans would have never found themselves.\\nTheres only one rub: how viable is the data running through these AI systems? AI doesn\'t appear in a vacuum. It\'s the result of the data behind it. Many industry experts are concerned that companies arent paying enough attention to the data that is driving their decision systems, data which may be deficient, too limited in scope, or stale. Dry data dries up innovation as well. Your data is constantly evolving as circumstances shift rapidly, says Arijit Sengupta CEO and founder of Aible Many AI projects fail because they are run on outdated or useless data and ignore the business realities.\\nData may be useless, or there simply may not be enough of the right data. \\"The most common mistake businesses make when implementing AI is believing that all of the necessary data exists in closed-loop systems,\\" says Melanie Nuce senior VP of innovation at GS1-US a nonprofit consortium developing digital trading standards. \\"Businesses may deploy AI with the belief that they can find value from the technology using all of their own data, but for AI to scale effectively, the data will likely need to be ingested and shared across trading partners.\\nAs reliance on AI grows, there is a risk of decisions going astray due to underlying data issues. A mistake even the most established enterprises continue to make is relying on data as the sole source of truth, says Sengupta. We need to understand that traditional AI doesn\'t have any understanding of your goals, cost-benefit tradeoffs or capacity constraints. All it knows is what is in your data. For that reason, data alone is the wrong basis for a successful AI strategy.\\nMORE FOR YOU","snippet":"getty Can <b><b>artificial intelligence</b></b> make us more creative and innovative?

ChatGPT, the newest chatbot from OpenAI, has undoubtedly generated a lot of buzz worldwide. For those with a college education and those whose careers depend on the creation of material, such as playwrights, professors, journalists, and programmers, it created a massive, never-before-seen threat. Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015, partly because he believed Google was not paying enough attention to AI safety. But, a new corporate conflict is now brewing; with Microsoft staunchly supporting ChatGPT, Google perhaps felt forced to introduce a rival, Bard, in quite a hurry. The frenzy has gotten so bad that Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, lost $100 billion because a Bard chatbot advertisement displayed inaccurate information, and analysts said that its AI search event lacked details on how it will respond to the ChatGPT challenge. How far can these chatbots go, though? And what kind of impact do they have on our lifestyles? Theres a possible impact on the job market, for sure. The usage of ChatGPT for student assignments is being outlawed by different colleges all across the world, which is causing a tremor in the educational system. Although some research articles featuring ChatGPT as the co-author have already been submitted for publication, society is also debating whether an AI may be allowed to be listed as the co-author of a research article.

A judge in Columbia recently used ChatGPT to decide whether an autistic childs insurance should cover all of the costs of his medical treatment. He even included his conversations with ChatGPT in the ruling! There is a general concern that in all of these situations, the human touch may be missing. MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum possibly created the first chatbot ever in 1966. It was called ELIZA and was named after a character in George Bernard Shaws play Pygmalion. Weizenbaum dismissed the idea that machines could replace human intellect at a time when experts predicted that chatbots would be indistinguishable from humans in a matter of years. Instead, he claimed that these things were merely tools and extensions of the human mind. He further emphasised that computers understanding of language was entirely dependent on the context in which they were used. The human intellect is currently being challenged by ChatGPT after traveling a long way over the past six decades, including Apples Siri, Google Now (which was replaced by Google Assistant in 2017), Microsofts Cortana, and Amazons Alexa, to name a few. And there will undoubtedly be many more surprises in the near future. As AI technology develops and is more thoroughly incorporated into a variety of industries, including the arts and humanities, the line between exploiting human creativity and using AI tools like ChatGPT will probably continue to become increasingly blurred in the near future. Even so, I think Weizenbaums fundamental concept may endure. It is unlikely that people whose jobs depend on content creation. will become entirely obsolete due to AI systems like ChatGPT or more advanced AIs in the near future. While AI can automate certain tasks, it is unlikely to replace human creativity and critical thinking, which are essential for these careers, according to ChatGPT, when I asked it about the future of humanity in this more AI-driven society. I agree. But I also think that AI might affect how people work, necessitating ongoing skill development and technological acculturation. Chatting with ChatGPT is fun, for sure. But to combat the widespread usage of ChatGPT-type AIs in our educational institutions, for example, we must innovate and create new types of assignments rather than panic. We also need to figure out how to distinguish human intelligence from artificial intelligence. During a chat conversation, ChatGPT told me that human imagination, emotions, and personal experiences are central to the creative process, and AI systems can never fully replicate these elements. In fact, AI technology has the potential to boost production and efficiency across a wide range of industries while also opening up new job opportunities.

Judges should not use ChatGPT when ruling on legal cases. It is not a substitute for the knowledge, expertise, and judgment of a human judge, it responded to a question from the British newspaper The Guardian. And journalists should exercise caution when using quotes generated by ChatGPT in their articles, the bot stated. Its a long way for chatbots from ELIZA to ChatGPT. Additionally, given the current craze and business opportunities, additional advancements and development of AI-based chatbots would indeed occur quickly. And it will be able to perform many tasks that humans might find difficult to achieve. But there is no doubt that it cannot replace the human touch. The worlds best human chess player at the time was defeated by Deep Blue, an AI, more than 25 years ago. Nowadays, chess engines powered by AI, like Leela Chess Zero and Stockfish, are unquestionably much better players than human players. The greatest Elo rating ever attained by a human was 2,882 in 2014 by Magnus Carlsen. Stockfish, on the other hand, has an Elo rating of over 3,500. Yet a contest between two of the best chess AI engines would be far less appealing than a contest between Carlsen and Ding Liren, for instance. This is where human intellect and touch defeat artificial intelligence. Let it be so.

Could I create the world\'s most effective dating profile via the power of machine learning?I set to work crafting prompts, starting simple, then goading ChatGPT toward increasing chaos.Prompt: \\"Write a 500-character dating app bio for a woman who likes music, books and houseplants.\\"Answer: \\"Music lover, bookworm, and proud plant parent. I spend my free time singing along to my favorite tunes, diving into the latest bestseller, and tending to my ever-growing collection of houseplants.

I would never.Prompt: Write a funny one-sentence response to the dating app prompt: \\"My zombie apocalypse plan is...\\"Answer: \\"My zombie apocalypse plan is to teach the zombies the cha-cha slide, because you can never have too much cardio in a crisis.\\"I stared at the response. It\'s a little funny. Cardio in a crisis? Is that from something? Does ChatGPT understand the underlying absurdity?I tried to inject some subtlety and subtext.Prompt: \\"Write an opener message for a dating app but don\'t ask the person out on a date yet.

If someone sent that greeting to me, I would delete the entire dating app, put my phone in a plastic bag, pitch it as far as possible into the depths of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository and spend the rest of my life training pigeons to deliver hard copies of memes to my friends. In an effort to process my feelings, I called TikToker Amelia Samson. Samson makes TikToks about the chemical fire that is modern dating and particularly about the mind-bendingly strange and offensive profiles floating around on The Apps. She gives voice to the rage-swaddled disbelief you feel every time someone writes \\"just ask\\" in their bio.\\"Oh no,\\" she said, when I read the \\"meow there\\" response to her over the phone, \\"ChatGPT is like the cringiest guy you\'ve ever dated.\\"There was so much to unpack. Could it be OK to use material from ChatGPT as long as it\'s accurate and you just need some help packaging what you want to say about yourself? Do other daters need to know you used ChatGPT?

What happens if you start talking about cha-cha sliding with zombies on your profile but can\'t muster that level of quirk in real life?\\"I think that there are ways to use it, especially for dating apps and writing things about yourself that are honest and make sense,\\" Samson said, \\"[but] as it keeps progressing, and growing and getting smarter, people could start to abuse it, and that\'s what I think is so scary about it.\\"Dating apps already struggle with problems like filters, bots and catfishing. The Federal Trade Commission reported that people lost $547 million to romance-based scams in 2021. And even if some hopeful dater with a ChatGPT account isn\'t trying to get you to pay for his pet iguana\'s surgery, misrepresentation is an age-old problem in the dating world.The jig is up, folks. You never finished reading Infinite Jest.Fake expert knowledgeOnce upon a time, fibbing about yourself would take some creativity. With ChatGPT, I didn\'t have to use any of my own brainpower to invent false details about myself. It supplied me with a fictional expert knowledge of Asian street foods, a penchant for crying in the car to Everybody Hurts by R.E.M., and a story about getting lost in Tuscany and ending up on a goat farm.\\"[It\'s] taking a lot of the legwork out of creating the lie,\\" Samson said.If this sounds like hand wringing, well, we all have our hobbies.I reached out to Bumble and OkCupid to see how aware apps like them are of this particular use of AI.Bumble said it\'s keeping an eye on the development of AI, broadly, and how it could affect both its community and business. \\"We are always reviewing the latest technology in consideration of what might make sense to add to our product,\\" a spokesperson said via email.OkCupid said it got ChatGPT to write some questions to ask daters, like what they most value in a partner or how they like to spend the weekend.WooPlus, a dating app for plus-size daters, added a ChatGPT help button people can use when they need assistance responding to messages from potential matches.

Gran Turismo maker Polyphony Digital has partnered with Sony to develop an AI character called Sophy that was not only skilled at accelerating a sports car, but also good at strategies and even race ethics. Described as \\"a revolutionary superhuman racing AI racing agent,\\" it is now coming to Gran Turismo 7 publicly for a limited time.\\nSophy will be available to race against, starting February 21 through the end of March. However, the perk is only being extended to PlayStation 5 owners. The game is getting a new GT Sophy Race Together mode that can be launched from within the GT7 world map. However, you need to be at least a Collector Level 6 racer to get a chance to face off against the AI.\\nIn the AI competition mode, players will battle it out against Sophy across four circuits, with each level being more challenging than the last one. The AI racer will switch to a car with more grunt as you reach higher difficulty levels.

In July 2021, Sophy went against the top Gran Turismo drivers, and the AI registered the best lap times across all three race events. However, the GT Top Driver Team claimed victory over the GT Sophy Team with an ultimate score of 86 to 70.\\nThe AI would again made an appearance at the Gran Turismo World Series 2022 (GTWS 2022) Showdown Event and the Gran Turismo World Series 2022 World Finals, where it went up against the world\'s four best Gran Turismo players. In a paper published in Nature, the team behind Sophy concluded that \\"it is possible to train AI agents that are better than the top human racers across a range of car and track types.\\" However, there are still a few key areas covering strategic decision-making where Sophy needed to improve, including making risky maneuvers.\\nRecommended","snippet":"... soon get a taste of what it feels like losing to <b><b>artificial intelligence</b></b>.
